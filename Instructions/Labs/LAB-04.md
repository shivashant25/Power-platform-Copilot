# Lab-04: Create a flow using the cloud flows designer with Copilot (Read Only).

## Lab scenario 

In this exercise, you will create a flow using the cloud flows designer in Microsoft Power Automate with the assistance of Copilot. Begin by accessing Power Automate and selecting the cloud flows designer to start a new flow. Use Copilot to guide you through defining triggers, setting up actions, and configuring conditions for your flow. Copilot will help streamline the process by suggesting best practices and automating repetitive tasks. Once you have set up your flow, test it to ensure it operates as expected. This lab will demonstrate how to leverage Copilot to efficiently build and optimize cloud flows.

## Lab objectives
In this lab, you will perform the following:

- Task-01 : Create a Flow.
- Task-02 : Edit a flow using the designer with copilot capabilities.

## Task-01: Create a Flow.

In this task, you'll create a new flow in Power Automate to automate a specific process. You'll define the trigger that initiates the flow, set up the actions to be performed, and configure any necessary conditions. This process will help streamline repetitive tasks and improve efficiency by automating workflows.

1.	Sign in to **https://make.powerautomate.com**.
   
2.	Start to describe your automation scenario.

3.	To accept the flow that Copilot created for you, select **Next**.
   
4.	Review your connected apps and services, and then select **Next**.
   
5.	To finalize your flow, configure the required settings, and then select **Create flow**.

6.	On the panel to the right, follow the Copilot suggestions to complete the flow setup, or make edits to your flow using Edit with Copilot.
   
7.	When your flow is complete, select **Save this flow**.
   
8.	Once your flow is saved, we recommend that you test it. Do this by selecting Test in the upper-right corner.
   
## Task -02 : Edit a flow using the designer with copilot capabilities

In this task, you'll edit an existing flow using the designer with Copilot capabilities in Power Automate. You'll access the flow in the designer, make modifications to triggers, actions, and conditions, and use Copilot's suggestions to optimize and refine the flow. This will enhance the flow’s functionality and ensure it meets your needs effectively.

1.	Sign in to **Power Automate**.
   
2.	On the left navigation pane, select **My flows**.
   
3.	Find your flow, select the **vertical ellipses (⋮)**, and then select **Edit**.

  >**Note** : Your flow opens with the Copilot pane on the side. You can now edit your flow by using the cloud flows designer with copilot capabilities. Try typing the following prompts.

  - a.	Delete action X.

  - b.	I want to send an email at the end of the flow with subject equal to the SharePoint file name.

  - c .	Instead of email, I want to post message on Teams channel.

  - d.	Check if each of the Sharepoint items being returned has a title that equals 'USB', and if so, send an email.

## Summary 
In this lab, you have accomplished the following:

- You have created a new flow in Power Automate to automate a specific process by setting up triggers and actions.
- You have edited the flow using the designer with Copilot capabilities, making enhancements and refinements based on Copilot's suggestions.
